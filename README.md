## About Me

Studying Information Systems since May 2023, I have a keen interest in understanding how software works at its most fundamental levels. I enjoy exploring concepts like memory management in C, as I believe a solid foundation is crucial for building good solutions. My practical experience comes largely from academic projects, where teamwork is essential to turn ideas into functional code.

## Focus and Technologies

Currently, my focus is on strengthening my foundations in back-end development, exploring not only the fundamental concepts but also the tools that bring them to life. My main interests are:

- **Languages and Runtimes:** Python, C, Node.js
- **Frameworks:** FastAPI, Django
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL
- **DevOps:** Docker

My goal is to achieve a deep understanding of these technologies to build robust and efficient solutions.

## Development Philosophy

I believe that a developer's strength lies not in the complexity of their tools, but in the depth of their understanding. My work is guided by solid principles that ensure the construction of software that is not only functional but also maintainable and resilient.

- **Code as Craftsmanship:** Writing code that not only works but is also intuitive and easy to evolve.
- **Protective Architecture:** Designing systems that protect data and business logic by anticipating failures.
- **Continuous Evolution:** Always learning and adapting to new technologies and the challenges they bring.
